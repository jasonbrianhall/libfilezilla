Overview
--------

libfilezilla is a free, open source C++ library, offering some basic
functionality to build high-performing, platform-independent programs. Some
of the highlights include:

- A typesafe, multi-threaded event system that's very simple to use yet extremely efficient
- Timers for periodic events
- A datetime class that not only tracks timestamp but also their accuracy, which simplifies dealing with timestamps originating from different sources
- Simple process handling for spawning child processes with redirected I/O
